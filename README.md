# Password-Generator
This is a secure, random password generating website that showcases my JavaScript knowledge. In order to make this website work, I had to make an array for the 4 different types of characters: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. After that I had to figure out how to create a range for the number of acceptable characters (between 8 -128). Once that was done, I had to figure out how to randomize the characters for each array and then get them put together in one string using loops. That was really difficult! After that, I had to get the number of characters inputed by the user to match what was displayed on the screen. That took so much trial and error. Once all of that was done, I had to relay all of these functions back to the generate button using an event 'click' function.
